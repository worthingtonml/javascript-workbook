/* Draw a 3x3 diminsioned box
Identify all win combinations for player 1
Assign "X" to player 1 and "O" to player 2
Player one inputs X as the first letter to occupy space on the board.
Player two inputs O second, filling an open space on the board. Ensure that player two cannot fill the same space as player 1.
Player one goes next and occupies an open space on the board that is not already occupied by an "X" or an "O" check for wins in rows, columns, and diagnals. Check for win.
Identify a winner once a win scenario has been fulfilled by player 1 or player 2. Alert winner. If all spaces have been filled nor has a win scenario been fulfilled, alert players appropriately.
Clear all occupied spaces on the board allowing player one to submit the first "X" on the board to restart the game.*/
